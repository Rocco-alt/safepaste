SafePaste Privacy Policy

SafePaste is a local-only browser extension. It does not collect, transmit, sell, or share personal data.

What SafePaste does:
- Detects paste events in supported AI chat input fields.
- Analyzes pasted text locally in your browser using rule-based checks.
- Shows a warning if the pasted text appears risky, and lets you cancel or paste anyway.
- Displays a toolbar popup showing SafePaste's status on the current site.
- Shows an icon badge ("ON" or "OFF") indicating whether SafePaste is active on the current tab.

What SafePaste does NOT do:
- No accounts or login.
- No tracking or analytics.
- No network requests or remote servers.
- No storage of pasted text.
- No analysis of uploaded images or screenshots (pasted text only).
- The service worker (background.js) manages only the icon badge and makes no network requests.

Data storage:
- SafePaste stores only your settings (enabled/disabled, strict mode, warning threshold, site toggles) in Chrome local storage.

Permissions:
- "storage" — Used to save your settings locally. No data is sent externally.
- "activeTab" — Used only so the toolbar popup can display the current site name. No data is read or sent.

Contact:
Use the support contact on the Chrome Web Store listing to reach the developer.
