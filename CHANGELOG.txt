SafePaste — Changelog

1.2.0
- Added browser popup for quick status view and per-site toggle (click the SafePaste icon).
- Added icon badge: green "ON" when active on an AI chat tab, gray "OFF" when disabled.
- Added service worker (background.js) for badge management.
- 10 new detection patterns (19 total): "from now on" overrides, DAN/developer mode jailbreaks,
  markdown image exfiltration, HTML img exfiltration, "new instructions" claims,
  "do not follow previous" overrides, unrestricted roleplay requests, secrecy framing,
  encoding/obfuscation references, output-constraining attacks.
- Shadow DOM support: MutationObserver scans for open shadow roots and attaches paste listeners
  directly, improving reliability on sites like Gemini.
- No new permissions added.

1.1.0
- Added Grok support (grok.com) with content script injection and settings toggle.
- Post-paste fallback for Grok: if clipboard text is not available (e.g., right-click paste),
  SafePaste lets the native paste through, detects the inserted text, and shows "Undo paste / Keep".
- Settings page updated with Grok toggle and explanatory note.

1.0.0
- Launch release.
- Paste interception + warning modal across supported AI chat sites.
- Local-only detection with no analytics or network requests.
- Strict mode + threshold controls + per-site toggles.
- Added Groq support (chat.groq.com, console.groq.com).
