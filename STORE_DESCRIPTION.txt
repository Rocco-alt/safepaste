SafePaste — AI Paste Shield

SafePaste warns you when pasted text may manipulate AI behavior (prompt injection).
This helps reduce risk when copying text from websites, documents, PDFs, or text copied from OCR'd screenshots into AI chat tools.

Features
- Detects paste events in supported AI chat inputs
- Flags common prompt-injection patterns (e.g., "ignore previous instructions", jailbreaks, data exfiltration via hidden markdown/HTML images)
- 19 detection rules covering instruction overrides, role hijacking, system prompt extraction, jailbreak techniques, secrecy framing, and obfuscation
- Simple warning with "Paste anyway" or "Cancel"
- Post-paste fallback: "Undo paste" or "Keep" on sites where clipboard text is not available before pasting
- Quick-access popup: click the SafePaste icon to see status and toggle per-site protection
- Icon badge shows "ON" (green) or "OFF" (gray) so you always know if SafePaste is active
- Optional strict mode and warning threshold controls
- Shadow DOM support for AI chat UIs that use it (e.g., Gemini)
- Local-only: no tracking, no accounts, no data collection

Supported sites (v1.2)

Privacy
SafePaste runs entirely on your device. It does not send pasted text anywhere.
SafePaste analyzes pasted text only. It does not analyze uploaded images.
The service worker (background.js) manages only the toolbar icon badge — it makes no network requests.

Notes
SafePaste is a safety aid, not a guarantee. It may miss attacks or flag harmless text.
